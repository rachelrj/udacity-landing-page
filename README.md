# Landing Page Project

Built/forked from [the udacity starter project](https://github.com/udacity/cd0428-landing-page).

The project is to convert from a static website to an interactive one. Steps included building a dynamic navigation, showing the user which section they're in, implementing navigation scroll, and including a mobile hamburger menu.

## Instructions

There are no build steps. Simply open the html file in a browser to run.
